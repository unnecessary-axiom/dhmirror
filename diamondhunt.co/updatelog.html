<br /><br />After a bit of back and fourth, the players asked if it was possible to have an official automatically tracked page in order to have real times.

<b style="font-size:14pt;">Diamond Hunt Mobile</b> <br /><br />
Some of you already know this, but I just want to take the time to share to you all what I've been working on. I'm currently doing a test-application for Diamond Hunt 2. Basically I'm creating a web application called Diamond Hunt Mobile which will be its own game. The main reason for this was to see if a web-app was the right way to go for a official DH2 web application.
<br /><br />
The goal of this small project is to create a much smaller scale of DH2 into a mobile app. This application will be operational on a separate server and does not interact with DH2 in anyway. If this application is successful, I will be making a DH2 application where you can login from your phone to play the game you play today.
<ul>
<li>The application is a web app. (Testing to see if a web-app is the way to go for DH2)</li>
<li>This application is single-player. There are no leaderboards or any multiplayer interaction.</li>
<li>This application will have microtransaction. I've mentioned plenty of times I hate these kinds of games but since it's a single player game I feel like it won't de-value other players playing w/o paying + it will generate some kind of revenue to support DH2.</li>
<li>The skills will be: Mining, Crafting, Woodcutting, Brewing and Exploring.</li>
<li>This application will remain up and running after completion if people want it.</li>
<li>Skill levels will go up to level 1000. (XP is earned much faster, and stardust is not a thing (so far at least?)</li>
</ul>

Random events may now occur in the game at any moment.  Although pretty rare, certain activities can open up for the whole server to join.
<br /><br />Here's what you need to know:<br />
<ul>
<li>Events are rare, they do not happen every day.  They also happen randomly (100% RNG).</li>
<li>Anyone can participate at any level.</li>
<li>The event only lasts a certain amount of time - about 30 minutes</li>
<li>When using an event, you will gain points.</li>
<li>You will gain more points if you have a higher level. (For example, fighting the giant requires combat, mining a meteor scales off mining, etc.)</li>
<li>Your loot scales based on how many points you get.</li>
<li>Finally, everyone gets more points if more people are active on the event.</li>
</ul>

Events:
<br />
<ul>
<li>Stardust meteor.</li>
<li>Promethium/Runite meteor.</li>
<li>Fishing Lake</li>
<li>Skeleton Slaughter.</li>
<li>Seed piles</li>
<li>Magic tree</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<i>Note: You might think that events don't spawn too often, but given the fact that some of them give quite a bit of loot and are essentially a one click effort, they should be rare to encounter.</i>

<b>For rare ores:</b>

<u>Excavators:</u>

For every second/tick, if a number is generated from <i style='color:red'>0 to (25000 - ([excavators on] * 1500) - ([mining level] * 7))</i> is equal to 0, 1 promethium is added.

<u>Giant Excavators:</u>

For every second/tick, if a number is generated from <i style='color:red'>0 to (25000 - ([giant excavators on] * 2000) - ([mining level] * 7))</i> is equal to 0, 3 promethium is added.<br />
For every second/tick, if a number is generated from <i style='color:red'>0 to (200000 - ([giant excavators on] * 6000) - ([mining level] * 700))</i> is equal to 0, 1 runite is added.

Currently, there is a link on the top page to 'submit a bug'.  For those who used that feature with good intention, thank you.  I have stopped replying to these posts
as a lot of them were spam/trolling.  I have decided to create a new system to avoid this problem: Players may now report a bug based on two criterias: <br /><br />
1 - They must have donated a minimal of 1$<br />
2 - They accept the term of conditions.<br /><br />
I took the time to program this new bug form this week; those who can submit bugs may now see other player-submitted bugs to avoid duplicates.<br />Thank you for making Diamond Hunt a more enjoyable games by submitting bug reports.

Hey guys, it's that time again.  I'm happy to say it's the last time I'll be saying this, but I'm going into exams for the next two weeks which will give me even less time to work on DH.
I'll do my best to update the game during that time, and will for sure fix bugs along the way.  The good news is I'll be graduating from Software Engineering afterwards so apart from work,
I can focus 100% on Diamond Hunt!  The Q&A will also be happening after the exams.  My last exam ends on <b>April 17th</b><br /><br />Hope you understand and thank you so much for the support! It's been great lately.

Brewing was always a tedious skill to train.  I like the concept of the skill however the XP rates were simply too low.
<br />I also thought about making some kind of magic cauldron where you would pour your potions and stardust into it for extra brewing XP, but from the player feedback, people didn't seem too interested so I decided to go with this simpler idea instead:<br /><br />
<u>You now gain brewing XP when drinking your potions.  Note: You only gain the extra XP if you actually use the benefit of the potion.</u>

<b style="font-size:14pt;">Faster Packet Algorithme + Server info (Technical) + Recap of these past few months</b> <br /><br />
Apart from the magic rework, I've been also working on a complete new algorithme to improve the quality of the general game play.  The goal of this new algorithme is to make the game have a much faster response time. As you may have noticed, the game works on a 1 second ticking system.  When you send commands to the server (example: Wielding an item, chopping a tree, cast a spell etc.), the server registers and processes your command.  Right now, the server tries to process the command in between every tick.  (A tick is one second).  After a second has gone by, the packet algorithme runs through all the players and constructs the new packets to be sent to the game client. (The website).  If the server is incapable of processing a command within that one second, it will continue to process it on the next second which can cause unwanted delays.  What this new algorithme does is every time a command is recieved, the new packet algorithme will construct the new command right away and send it back to the client.  This removes that one second delay caused by the ticking system.  However, this algorithme requires more CPU power and bandwidth.  The algorithme has been enabled for <b>equipement items only.</b>  If the test works well on these items, I'll be looking to do it across all the items in the game.  <br /><br />Second thing, I want to be transparent with you guys and you may have noticed we have not hit 1000 players online in a while.  Obviously this means the revnue stream of the game has decreased.  This new algorithme might need too much CPU power and I am willing to upgrade the server only if the community really sees a difference in the response time.  If the new algorithme is not really needed, I'll be removing it and won't be upgrading the server.
<br /><br />
Lastly, some of you might not like the idea of donor coins being tradable but I'm going to be giving it a try.  Players may now purchase donor items without actually needing to spend any real money.  This should also help revnue streams which would allow me to keep the algorithm and comfortably upgrade the server if need be.  I hope you understand why I'm doing this.  I also want to mention that my motivation for diamond hunt is still going strong.  I plan to spend a lot of time on programming DH in the next few weeks the fact that we have less players online does not make me want to code this game less.  It's a lot of fun for me and enjoy every bit of it!
<br /><br />
<b><u>TL;DR:</u></b>
<br />Changing equipement items for your hero should be lightning fast.<br />
If all goes well, the response time of the game should be much faster in the next few patches.<br />
The increase in the server's response time uses more CPU power and I might have to rent more hardware to achieve this.<br />
Even though the player count has been much lower than usual, my motivaiton stays strong for programming this game!  And I know we will reach that 1k players online again!

<u>New hero bonus</u>
<br />
<ul>
<li><img src='https://diamondhunt.co/images/icons/wizardHatIcon.png' class='image-icon-20' /> A magic bonus from new robe equipements.</li>
<li>Every spell requires a minimum magic bonus, and some spells will scale based on magic bonus.</li>
<li>Current magic weapons will have magic bonuses.</li>
<li>The combat interface will be reworked to allow players to easily switch gears during battle. (For example: It might be useful to quickly switch into your magic gear and then cast all your spells in order to have a higher magic bonus.  Then quickly switching back to avoid NPC damage.</li>
<li>To continue on the previous point, switching combat equipement will no longer be locked behind the hard achievements.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<u>New equipement</u>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Magic robes will be the primary way of gaining magic bonuses.</li>
<li>Magic amulets and rings will also be added to allow your hero to have a bit of magic bonuses to help cast basic spells with melee armour on.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<u>What about our essences/wand etc?</u>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Still brainstorming on what to do with essences.</li>
<li>If the wand is removed (or it might be used as a weapon..? TBA) Your logs used when upgrading the wand will be fully refunded.</li>
<li>The spellscroll 1 will be removed.</li>

Hello guys!  Just wanted to give you guys a little update on what's been happening.  I just started my full time internship along with a 4 month end of bachelors project which are both followed by professonals in the software engineering field. I started my intership and the project this week and I have decided to set an official weekly day for Diamond Hunt updates.  This will allow me to mange my time, and I'll be able to add new content and really test everything before release on mondays.  I'll be working on Diamond Hunt everyday and hopefully will deliver awesome new content on a weekly basis.<br /><br /><b>Info:</b><br /><ul><li>Updates will occure every Monday.</li><li>All bug reports will be answered on Monday, right before the update.</li><li>Server will be monitored for a few hours after the updates go live to hot fix bugs if they rise.</li><li>These weekly updates should contain much more content at once as I have all week to work/test them.</li></ul>

<b style="font-size:14pt;">What's next?</b> <br /><br />
So I just got back from my trip, and I wanted to rework some of the backend of the system.  This includes reworking the bot detector, the alt trading detector, and 
the network layer of the game.  This may take a bit of time which will reduce the amount of content updates we will get.  However, I'll do my best to release content
as well as reworking the backend.  After the backend is revamped, I'm going to re-read all the recent reddit posts which I've responded to (or not) to implement the tweaks
and content some of you have suggested. The backend work should take around 8h, and I'm going to work on that today and tomorow.  Thanks for understanding!

<b style="font-size:14pt;">The rollback.</b> <br /><br />
Hello guys, so this is the first time DH2 had to execute a major roleback.  4H of progress was lost for everyone who was logged in after the update of today.  This is the story; and usually 
with bugs like this I can fix them really quickly, but this time was different.  If you're interested, keep reading, if not read the TL;DR.  So after the update today, I ran all tests and everything seemed fine.  I decide
to leave the house to go downtown with my GF to a festival (just for laughs).  I order a drink, it's 2:30 PM at this point (2h after the update went live).  I get a message from my brother with the title 'BIG BUG'.  I
see his post and I realize players are able to create stardust from nothing using the rocket.  I'm with my gf and tell her we gotta go.  She understands and we throw our drink out and get back in our
car to fight traffic to my school (which was the closest place i could get to a computer).  I knew there was a bug 2H in, but I had to fight traffic to get to my university which took a long time.
Anyways, I wanted to take the time to explain to you the situation.  This is the first actually 'dupe' bug we had in the game.  I take this stuff very seriously and will always stop whatever I'm doing
to fix these kinds of things straight away.  I had to roll back.  There was already hundreds of millions of stardust created from bug abuse that was generated out of thin air, and for the sake of the economy the roll back was a must.
<br /><br />
Sorry for the legit players who had to lose progress or items because of this - I had to do it, for the better of the game/economy.  I will do my best to prevent such bugs in the future and improve my tests so we don't run into this problem again.
Thanks for those who understand.
<br /><br />
<b>TL;DR: A bug was found after the update today which allowed players to create stardust from thin air.  This was abused and over 100M stardust was created.  Rollbacks were executed and were necessary to conserve the economy.</b>

I wanted to share a little story.  A highschool near my hometown has a team where they compete in programming robots to do cool things.  They had a competition Canada wide and 
took the third place.  They have been qualified to go to an international tournament where they compete against other teams all around the world.  I'm proud to announce that
a small portion of your donations have been given to this team to support them.  100$ of donor money has been donated to the robotic team to pay for travel expenses, food, hotels etc.  If you want
to know more, you may read the article <a href='http://www.journaldechambly.com/actualites/2017/5/23/l_ecole-secondaire-de-chambly-couronnee-championne-en-robotique.html' target="_blank">here</a> (in french).

Also, I'd like to thank everyone who has supported me with Diamond Hunt.  I still have a lot of plans in terms of adding new content to the game.  Hopefully you'll be around to enjoy it!  Thanks again guys!<br /><br />-Smitty

some magic spells share the same cooldown.  You can see which spells share the same cooldown based on the background
color of that spell.  (For example. pound, gust and bubble all share the same cooldown.  This means you cannot cast them all one after another.)

The goal of reworking the core of the backend engine is to improve performance and the response time of the overall game.  In this case, the login system and the in-game hiscores have been reworked
to imporve performance.  It should reduce the bottle necks we've been having on server restarts.  On top of that, connecting to the game should be faster.

<div class="sub-content">
<b style="font-size:14pt;">Clan chats - current thoughts</b><br /><br />
As some of you know, I've been working a system where players can create group/clan chats and invite friends to join. (Like a chat room) However, I'm not sure if I want this in the game - I need your opinion.
<br /><br />
<i>I know private chatrooms sound good, but I have a feeling this will make the general chat more dead.  I don't want to split the community into small groups.  The chat is a great
tool for new players to ask questions and get an answer quickly, having chat rooms might make the general chat not as active as it used to be.  I'm still open on adding this update, but I'd
like some input from you guys about this concern so I made a thread on reddit <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/DiamondHunt/comments/6bixnh/char_rooms_is_it_a_good_thing/'>here</a></i>
